Two flagship dark themes based on Gruvbox, built for long coding sessions in Python, C, and LaTeX.

## Acknowledgment

This theme collection is based on the excellent [Gruvbox Theme by jdinhify](https://github.com/jdinhify/vscode-theme-gruvbox). The Pop variant draws inspiration from the Cursor Dark Anysphere and Dracula palettes.

## Theme Variants

### CoMPhy Gruvbox Classic

Traditional Gruvbox dark with `#1d2021` background. Warm, familiar palette optimized for readability with properly differentiated terminal bright colors and WCAG-aware comment contrast.

### CoMPhy Gruvbox Pop

Pure black (`#000000`) background with a vibrant Dracula-inspired syntax palette. Designed for maximum visual impact and all-day comfort:

- Warm off-white foreground (`#e8e0d4`) to reduce halation
- Hot pink functions, bright green strings, pale yellow keywords
- Purple/cyan type system, muted blue-gray comments
- Subtle line highlighting visible on pure black

### CoMPhy Gruvbox Plum

Near-black (`#111111`) background with the CoMPhy brand purple `#68236D` as the UI accent — selection, focus ring, active tab, buttons and badges all resolve to the lab's `--c-brand-purple`. Syntax leans further into the Dracula palette:

- Bright `#FCFCFC` foreground on `#111111`, side surfaces at `#161616`
- Pale yellow keywords, bright green strings, hot pink functions
- Cyan classes/types, orange operators, cool blue-gray comments
- Brand-purple selection at 40% opacity keeps highlighted code legible

## Features

- Dedicated C/C++ syntax scopes (preprocessor, macros, structs, pointers, sizeof)
- Markdown heading hierarchy (H1-H6 warm-to-cool color gradient)
- Enhanced Shell scripting (pipes, redirects, heredocs, builtins)
- CSS/SCSS support (IDs, pseudo-classes, variables, units, !important)
- Python enhancements (docstrings, exceptions, logical operators)
- Regex highlighting (patterns, character classes, quantifiers, anchors)
- ~30 semantic token definitions including Python-specific tokens
- Comprehensive LaTeX support (math mode, citations, sections)
- UI polish: sticky scroll, breadcrumbs, notifications, diff editor, inlay hints

   - Package the extension into a `.vsix` file
   - Display the package size and filename

### Manual Build Steps

If you prefer to run the build steps manually:

1. Generate theme files:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   # or
   node scripts/build-themes.js
   ```
