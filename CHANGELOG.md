## [4.1.0] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- **New theme "CoMPhy Gruvbox Plum"**: a third flagship variant derived from Pop, recoloured around the CoMPhy brand purple `#68236D` (the design system's `--c-brand-purple`). `#111111` editor background with `#161616` side surfaces, `#FCFCFC` foreground, brand-purple selection, focus ring, tabs, buttons and badges. Token accents shift toward Dracula hues: yellow keywords `#f1fa8c`, green strings `#50fa7b`, pink functions `#ff79c6`, cyan classes `#8be9fd`, orange operators `#ffb86c`, cool comments `#7887ab`.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added

- **C/C++ syntax scopes**: 8 new rules for preprocessor directives, macro names, include paths, struct/union/enum types, pointer/address operators, sizeof/alignof, function definitions, and member access operators.
- **Markdown heading hierarchy**: H1-H6 with warm-to-cool color gradient (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple). Additional rules for blockquotes, list markers, fenced code language, and strikethrough.
- **Shell script enhancements**: 5 new rules for keywords, pipe/redirect operators, command substitution, builtins, and heredocs.
- **CSS/SCSS scopes**: ID selectors, pseudo-classes, property values, units, CSS variables, and `!important`.
- **Python enhancements**: Docstrings (italic gray, comment-like), exception classes, and logical operators.
- **Regex scopes**: Patterns, character classes, quantifiers, and anchors.
- **Semantic tokens expanded** from 17 to ~32: Added `decorator`, `selfParameter:python`, `clsParameter:python`, `magicFunction:python`, `variable.defaultLibrary`, `function.defaultLibrary`, `class.defaultLibrary`, `type.defaultLibrary`, `macro`, `label`, `property.readonly`, `variable.declaration`, `function.declaration`, `method.declaration`.
- **UI polish**: Sticky scroll backgrounds, breadcrumb colors, notification colors, diff editor backgrounds, gutter indicators, and inlay hint styling.
- **Terminal bright color differentiation** (Classic): Bright variants now visually distinct from normal ANSI colors.

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Consolidated from 6 themes to 2 flagship themes:
  - "CoMPhy Gruvbox (High Contrast)" renamed to **"CoMPhy Gruvbox Classic"**
  - "CoMPhy Gruvbox Anysphere (Highest Contrast, pop)" renamed to **"CoMPhy Gruvbox Pop"**
- **Comment contrast improved**: Base comments changed from `#7c6f64` (~2.8:1) to `#928374` (~4.5:1 on Classic). Pop comments changed from `#6272a4` (~3.2:1) to `#7887ab` (~5.0:1 on black).
- **Pop foreground softened**: Now uses warm off-white `#e8e0d4` instead of pure white `#ffffff` (14.8:1 contrast, still AAA) to reduce halation during long sessions.
- **Pop variable color**: Updated from `#f8f8f2` to `#e2dcd0` for better visual hierarchy.
- **Line highlight visibility**: Classic uses `#ebdbb210` (warm tint at 6% opacity), Pop uses `#ffffff0d` (white at 5% opacity).
- **LaTeX comment color** updated to match base comment color `#928374`.

### Removed

- **BREAKING**: `CoMPhy Gruvbox (Soft)` variant (too similar to Classic).
- **BREAKING**: `CoMPhy Gruvbox Anysphere (High Contrast)` variant (middle ground that served no distinct purpose).
- `CoMPhy Gruvbox (Medium)` variant (removed in prior unreleased work).
- `CoMPhy Gruvbox Anysphere Blend` variant (removed in prior unreleased work).

### Migration Notes

## [1.3.0] - 2025-09-05

### Added

  - Purple‑forward accents (focus/links `#bd93f9`, buttons/cursor `#9b4fa0`)

### Notes

- The **Highest Contrast, pop** variant uses pure black (`#000000`) specifically for monitors requiring extreme contrast and maximum "pop" effect
